# cljgo — agent instructions

Clojure hosted on Go: compiler in Go, AOT-emits plain Go source (CLJS model),
tree-walk evaluator = the REPL + macro engine. Module `github.com/muthuishere/cljgo`, go 1.26.

## Authority chain (read in this order when deciding anything)

1. `docs/adr/` — decisions. Binding until superseded by a newer ADR.
2. `design/00-architecture.md` — cross-component contracts + M0–M5 roadmap.
3. `design/01–07` — component internals (reader, data structures, analyzer/eval,
   emitter, interop/concurrency, spikes).
4. `openspec/` — active change proposals (`openspec list`).

## Process — ADR → propose → apply

For any non-trivial change (new capability, contract change, milestone stage):
1. **ADR first** if it involves a new decision or reverses one — `docs/adr/NNNN-slug.md`
   (context / decision / consequences; supersede, don't edit history).
2. **`/opsx:propose`** — OpenSpec proposal + design + spec deltas under `openspec/changes/`.
3. **Apply** via tasks; **archive** when done.
Trivial fixes skip OpenSpec; nothing skips gates.

## Gates (before every commit)

```
go build ./... && go vet ./... && gofmt -l pkg cmd conformance && go test ./...
```
All green, no exceptions. `refs/` is fenced with a stub go.mod — leave it.

## Conformance discipline

- Every semantic behavior = a `conformance/tests/*.clj` file with frozen
  `;; expect:` output, verified against real JVM Clojure 1.12.5 (`clojure` CLI —
  the semantic oracle, needed at authoring time only) and cited in a comment.
- From M2 the same files also run AOT-compiled (dual harness). REPL-vs-binary
  divergence is THE unforgivable failure mode — release blocker.
- Perf budgets are CI-checked like tests (owner mandate: performance is a
  feature; see design/00 §1.4).

## Hard rules

- Never commit compiled binaries (`/cljgo`, spike artifacts).
- `pkg/lang` is vendored from Glojure — keep EPL headers on vendored files,
  log meaningful surgery in `pkg/lang/PROVENANCE.md` / `TODO.md`.
- Never add `Co-authored-by:` to commits.
- `refs/` is read-only history. CLOSED spikes (those with a VERDICT.md) are
  frozen; NEW spikes follow the ADR 0027 lifecycle (spike → close → ADR →
  spec → apply).
- Verify Clojure behavior against the real `clojure` CLI, not memory.

## Layout

`pkg/lang` runtime · `pkg/reader` · `pkg/ast` · `pkg/analyzer` · `pkg/eval` ·
`pkg/repl` · `cmd/cljgo` · `core/` (core.clj, Clojure-in-Clojure) ·
`conformance/` · `design/` · `docs/adr/` · `openspec/` · `spikes/` (frozen) ·
`refs/` (gitignored clones).

## The precedence principle (owner, 2026-07-12)

**Clojure is first-class.** Everything we add (comptime, Result/Option, ffi,
testing forms, diagnostics) exists to make it BETTER, never different: an
addition may not shadow, rename, or change the semantics of anything in
clojure.core or the reader. When a new feature's natural name collides with
Clojure (e.g. `some`), the NEW feature renames (=> `just`/`none`), never
Clojure. Ratified example: ADR 0014 constructors are `just`/`none`.
